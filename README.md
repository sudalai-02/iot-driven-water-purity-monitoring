# IoT-Driven Water Purity Monitoring

## Overview

This project implements an IoT-driven water purity monitoring system that continuously measures water quality parameters and provides real-time data through a cloud-based platform. It aims to ensure the safety and cleanliness of water by monitoring key indicators such as pH, turbidity, and dissolved solids.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks water quality metrics.
- **IoT Integration**: Sends data to a cloud server for remote access and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays water quality data through a web or mobile application.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends alerts for abnormal water quality readings.
- **Historical Data Storage**: Keeps records of water quality over time for trend analysis.

## Components Used

- **Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)**: Manages data acquisition and communication.
- **Water Quality Sensors**: Measures parameters such as pH, turbidity, and dissolved solids.
- **Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32)**: Connects the system to the internet for data transmission.
- **Cloud Platform (e.g., AWS, ThingSpeak)**: Hosts and analyzes data.
- **Power Supply**: Provides necessary power for the sensors and microcontroller.
- **Optional: Display**: Shows real-time data locally.

## Circuit Diagram

Refer to the `circuit_diagram.pdf` file for detailed wiring instructions, including connections between the sensors, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi module.

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the water quality sensors to the microcontroller according to the circuit diagram.
   - Integrate the Wi-Fi module to enable internet connectivity.
   - Ensure proper power connections.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the necessary libraries for the sensors and Wi-Fi module.
   - Upload the provided Arduino code (`WaterPurityMonitoring.ino`) to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
   - Configure cloud settings and data endpoints in the code.

3. **Operation**:
   - The system will continuously monitor water quality and send data to the cloud.
   - Access the data through the web or mobile application and receive alerts if water quality deviates from acceptable levels.

## Code

The Arduino code is provided in the `WaterPurityMonitoring.ino` file. It handles:
- Initialization of sensors and Wi-Fi module.
- Data acquisition and transmission to the cloud.
- Alert generation for abnormal water quality.
